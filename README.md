# LoginSolution
Status: WIP

A user authentication solution that combines client side scripting (JS), server side scripting (PHP), with a MySQL/MariaDB database.

The application allows the user to register an account. The registration process, in addition to name and credential fields also allows the user to store their address and contact information. After registering, the user can login, view the information they registered with, and update certain fields if needed.

Several concepts are explored: 

Components:

login.php
loginProcess.php
registration.php
registrationProcess.php
update.php
updateProcess.php
utilities.php
dbUtilities.php
logout.php
